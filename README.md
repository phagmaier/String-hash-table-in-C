# SUMMARY
Implimentation of a Hash table/dictionary (and also a dynamic array/vector becuase i used that check to make
sure that we were correctly parsing and adding to the dictionary).
The program currently parses Moby dick into words and counts the occurances of each word
in a hash table and then displays the results. Does all of this in less than a second on my machine
so it has relativley decent performance

# TO-DO (maybe)
1. Should probably make a actual Hash Table structure that has the array with it so you don't
have to pass the array and have a suplimentary array with you at all times that's pretty stupid
2. Probably should initialize everything to NULL/0
3. But mostly just need to make it one structure putting it twice cause it's dumb i didn't
