# SUMMARY
Haven't implimented a hash table in a while and I don't know if I ever did one in C and I thought maybe it could come in handy
later. I also have a parser implimented and the main will basically parse a file moby dick in the this case and we'll
count all the instances of the words. There's also a vector implimentation for Strings in here so I can get all the words
in the book without having to know the exact size. Will have that up tomorow.
