# SUMMARY
Implimentation of a Hash table/dictionary
The program currently parses Moby dick into words and counts the occurances of each word
in a hash table and then displays the results. Does all of this in less than a second on my machine
so it has relativley decent performance.
Was also testing using a vector/dynamic array at first so a lot of the functions can also work
with a dynamic array. It probably should be taken out of the code because it bloats it
but it shouldn't be a big deal it's not that much code and it's not being used.
The dictionary works can proabbly add a few more functions for convencience like maybe deleting a specific
node given a string or a index but I think i'm satisfied with it.
